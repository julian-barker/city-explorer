# Project Name

**Author**: Julian Barker
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

This application is our intro to servers, the web request response cycle, and APIs.  We will be building a React application that uses the Axios library to make user-initiated requests for data from a third-party API. W will use the LocationIQ GeoLocating API.

## Getting Started

1. create-react-app
2. delete cruft
3. add form to App component to gather user input
4. get locationIQ API key and store in .env
5. request data from Location IQ API using the key and the seach input value
6. display data or error message based on the response from the server
7. use data to create source url for the map
8. display the map in an `<img>` tag, with the aforementioned `src` attribute.

## Architecture

Technologies: React, Javascript, Axios, LocationIQ Geolocating API
